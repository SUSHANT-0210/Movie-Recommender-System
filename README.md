## Introduction

In this project, we have implemented a content-based movie recommendation system using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on user interactions and preferences, a content-based approach recommends items similar to those the user has liked in the past. The system utilizes cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movie features.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The system analyzes movie features such as genre, actors, directors, and plot keywords to recommend similar movies based on user preferences.
- **Scalable**: The system can efficiently handle a large movie database and provide relevant recommendations.
- **Easy to Use**: Users can easily interact with the system through a Streamlit-based user interface, which provides an intuitive and responsive experience.
- **Web Deployment**: The project is deployed on the Streamlit community cloud, making it accessible at [MovieNest](https://movienest.streamlit.app/).

## Technologies Used
